The Lord of the Rings Trilogy: Three Volumes in Slipcase,"For someone in the third world $... is a huge investment. But I'm glad I ordered a book a couple of years ago. I'm a proud owner of this edition that a lot friends want to keep for their own. The centennial edition is the most elegant among all the LOTR sets I've seen. An added case would have made it more valuable. Considering the book's weight, the binding is surprisingly sturdy compared to most hardcover books.Alan Lee's illustration are simply marvelous. (The movie draws much of inspiration from Lee's images; Lee afterall provided the initial designs for the film I understand.) It's a good thing that the publishers decided to print the color plates on coated paper and the text on book paper. Text on coated paper is a bit difficult to read and stick to one another in time, especially under tropical conditions where I live.Well, I don't there is anything more to add to what people have said about the novel itself. Either you love it or you hate it. If you're one of those who love Tolkien, this one edition to keep, re-read and re-read, and display. I've lost so many copies of LOTR in the past 30 years. Certainly, this is one set to own. It's one convenienet volume everyone wants to borrow, but I'm not sure if any onw would want to lend.
